        One of the biggest highlights of the Sniper 155R ABS version is its Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), which greatly enhances rider safety by preventing wheel lock-up during sudden braking. Powered by a 155cc liquid-cooled, 4-valve engine with Variable Valve Actuation (VVA), the bike offers impressive power and fuel efficiency — ideal for both urban commuting and weekend rides.

        For Filipino riders and fans of sporty underbone motorcycles, the Sniper 155R ABS sets a new benchmark. With a blend of racing technology and real-world usability, this bike proves Yamaha’s commitment to innovation and rider satisfaction.
