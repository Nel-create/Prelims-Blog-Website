      <p> Manny Pacquiao aimed to break his own record as the oldest welterweight world champion in boxing history but fell just short. Two judges scored the fight evenly at 114 to 114, while the third gave a narrow 115 to 113 decision in favor of Mario Barrios.

“I thought I won,” Pacquiao said. “It was a close fight. He was very tough. I trained hard and stayed disciplined. I always keep myself in shape so I can keep doing this.”

Barrios expressed admiration for Pacquiao, calling the experience unforgettable. “It was an honor to share the ring with him,” Barrios said. “This has been the biggest moment of my career so far. We gave everything we had in that ring. I have nothing but respect for Manny.”

CompuBox punch statistics highlighted the close nature of the match. Pacquiao had the edge in power punches, landing 81 compared to Barrios’s 75. Barrios, on the other hand, landed 45 jabs while Pacquiao connected with only 20. With a packed crowd cheering every exchange, Pacquiao showed signs of improvement since his last fight in 2021.

“His stamina is incredible,” Barrios noted. “He’s still very strong and his timing is sharp. He remains a very tricky opponent to deal with.”

Pacquiao’s most impressive moment came in the eighth round when he unleashed a series of left hooks that energized the crowd just before the bell. Although it appeared the momentum had shifted in Pacquiao’s favor, Barrios responded by winning the final three rounds on all judges' scorecards, which secured the draw and allowed him to retain his title.

“I wanted to finish the fight stronger, but my opponent was really tough,” Pacquiao said. “He threw a lot of good combinations and defended well. It was not an easy fight.”

Barrios commented on the closing rounds, saying, “I never felt like I was losing, but I knew I had to turn it up to make sure I got the result. The game plan was to pressure him and make him feel his age, but he still moves very well.”

Both fighters showed interest in a rematch after the bout.

“I need more training time if I’m going into another championship fight,” Pacquiao said. “Because of the election, I started late this time, but it’s okay. I definitely want a rematch. I want to leave a strong legacy and make the Filipino people proud.”

“I’m all in for a rematch,” Barrios said. “This was a great night for boxing. I would love to do it again.”
