      <p>COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus disease 2019, is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a global pandemic in March 2020.</p>

      <p>The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. People can also become infected by touching surfaces that have the virus on them and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>

      <p>Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, and loss of taste or smell. In more severe cases, it can cause difficulty breathing, chest pain, or even death, especially in older adults or those with underlying health conditions.</p>

      <p>To prevent the spread of COVID-19, health experts recommend frequent handwashing, wearing masks, maintaining physical distance from others, and getting vaccinated. Vaccines have proven effective at reducing the severity of the disease and preventing hospitalizations.</p>

      <p>As of today, several variants of the virus have emerged, such as Delta and Omicron. These variants spread more easily, but vaccines and boosters still offer protection, especially against severe illness.</p>

      <p>COVID-19 continues to affect communities around the world. Staying informed and following public health guidelines helps protect individuals and those around them.</p>
